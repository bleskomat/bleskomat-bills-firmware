# Improve case

* Button
  * correct size
  * move it to the right, centered

* Coin
  * coin catcher, needs to have whole to catch the coin, like in the woodern one
    * use 50 czk as measurement tool (50% of it)
  * coin protection (scratch resistant), stain still thingy (later cut for precision)

* Screen
  * give Ondra the burnt screen for reference

* 12V on the left side from front
  * probably we want electronics in that side as well, so it does not conflicts with coin and bill open.
  * hight of above the octopus

* Octopus
  * stopper on each side that are not part of the octopus it self but keep the octopus from moving around. And then the octopus would be the size that allows it to be extraccted easily.

* coin acceptor holder
  * The support needs to be shifted over to closer to the bill acceptor and it needs to have a metal structure that allows the coin acceptor to be inserted so it is fixed there.
